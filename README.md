## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Technical Issue

### Frontend-Backend Integration

One of the main technical challenges encountered was **linking the React frontend (built with TypeScript) to the Flask backend (Python)**. This issue arose due to:

1. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**  
   Flask needed proper CORS headers configured to allow requests from the frontend (usually running on a different port during development). This was resolved using the `flask-cors` package.

   ```python
   from flask_cors import CORS
   CORS(app)
